# About
I'm a third-year computer science Ph.D. student working under the advisory of Dr. Taylor T. Johnson in the VeriVITAL lab. I am primarily focused on developing new techniques in computer-aided verification for machine learning-based system, particularly those systems which analyze images, videos, or other high-dimensional data. I also have a growing interest in working with numerical methods and scientific software.
