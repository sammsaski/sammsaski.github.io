# About
I'm a second-year computer science Ph.D. student working under the advisory of Dr. Taylor T. Johnson in the VeriVITAL lab.
I am primarily focused on developing new techniques in computer-aided verification for machine learning-based systems,
particularly those systems which analyze images, videos, or other high-dimensional data. I also have a growing interest in    working with numerical methods and scientific software.

If anyone is interested about my work or in collaborating, please do not hesitate to reach out!
