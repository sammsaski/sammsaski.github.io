To update the contents of the website, you must edit the `index.md` file using markdown.

To do:
- Figure out the other headings / pages.
    - News
    - Publications
    - Selected Publications
    - Projects
    - Blog
    - Education
    - Resume
- Figure out a system for structuring + automatically parsing from another file. This way, I can just record the information in one place and have it automatically populate the website.

To see changes locally:
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Navigate to localhost:4000

Development:
A good strategy for development is to
1. Open a new branch for changes
2. Make the changes and serve the site locally to observe changes instantly
