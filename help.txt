To update the contents of the website, you must edit the `index.md` file using markdown.

To do:
- Figure out the other headings / pages.
    - News
    - Publications
    - Selected Publications
    - Projects
    - Blog
    - Education
    - Resume
- Figure out a system for structuring + automatically parsing from another file. This way, I can just record the information in one place and have it automatically populate the website.
